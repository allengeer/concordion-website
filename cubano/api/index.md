This framework includes [HttpEasy](./httpeasy), a fluent wrapper for REST / SOAP / HTTP, built around HttpUrlConnection.  The primary driver for this library was to create something that would work through corporate proxies - especially NTLM proxies, which is something that many libraries struggle with. 

## Alternatives:

* [RestAssured](http://rest-assured.io) is a very popular option
* [RestEasy](http://resteasy.jboss.org)
* [jcabi-http](https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-http)
* [http-request](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/http-request)
* wsimport
* SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ)
* Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS)
* Apache Camel. Camel will help you to:
    * Consume data from any source/format
    * Process this data
    * Output data to any source/format

  Apache Camel is developed with [Enterprise Integration Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_application_integration)
    
  There are some Eclipse plugins at http://tools.jboss.org/features/apachecamel.html (link currently broken) that offer drag and drop support for building and testing.
